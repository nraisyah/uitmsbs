      TANJUNG MALIM: The 2022 Institutions of Higher Learning Games (SUKIPT) is set to return from Aug 12 to 21 at Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) here after a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19.

      Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad(pix) said over 6,000 athletes representing 70 contingents would be at UPSI to battle it out for the 210 gold medals offered.

      “The ministry has agreed to provide several new incentives, namely RM3,000 cash prize for SUKIPT Sportsman and Sportswoman.

      “The Best Men’s and Women’s Team will receive RM7,000 in cash each and players who successfully hit a hole-in-one in golf will be offered RM1,000 in cash,” she said in her speech when opening SUKIPT 2022 at UPSI’s Sultan Azlan Shah Campus here today.

      She added that cash prizes amounting to RM20,000 will be distributed among athletes who managed to break the national record at the sports meet, which was first held in 2012.

      <br><br>On 21 January 202
      3, I officiated the closing ceremony of the 2023 Inter-faculty Sports Championship (SAF) which was held physically post-pandemic at UiTM Shah Alam Stadium after it was last held in 2019. The SAF tournament was held from 6 January to 21 January 2023 at UiTM Shah Alam. A total of 6959 athletes, officers, and volunteers from 17 faculties of UiTM Shah Alam and UiTM Selangor branch were involved in 22 team and individual sports events. Among the sporting events contested are Netball, 10-sided Rugby, 5-sided Football, Volleyball, Badminton, Handball, Tennis, Archery, and E-Sports PlayerUnknown BattleGrounds (PUBG) and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) tournaments.
      I hoped that UiTM students would actively involve in sports activities, and could revitalize the "Sporting Campus" atmosphere through the organization of sports tournaments of its kind. I could assure that UiTM through the Student Affairs Sports Centre to be aware of the needs of students' sports activities, to provide continuous encouragement to students to participate in campus sports activities, and in turn, to form a culture of vibrant and healthy quality campus community.</p>
